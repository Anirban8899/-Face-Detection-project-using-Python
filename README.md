Face Detection project using Python | Python,Opencv,Vscode

        • Developed a face detection system using Python, focusing on accurately identifying and 

          locating faces in images and videos.
      
        • Implemented real-time face detection using OpenCV and machine learning algorithms.

        • Enhanced detection accuracy by fine-tuning models and using feature extraction techniques.

        • Integrated facial landmark detection to improve recognition precision and track facial expressions.
